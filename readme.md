# Kotlin JPA


## Outcomes: 

1. donâ€™t use data classes with val properties because JPA is not designed to work with immutable classes or the methods generated automatically by data classes https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/
   * using data classes as JPA entities is generally discouraged https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/jpa
2. always use normal classes for Entities 
3. do not rely on equals and hashcode generated by default Kotlin/Java or Intellij Idea. Always define/override equals and hashcode by yourself based on the business logic

4. listen your mom write unit tests
